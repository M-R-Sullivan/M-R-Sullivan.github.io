#### <u>Network externalities in the dating website industry</u>

[Link ![NetExt as pdf]({{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/icons16/pdf-icon.png)]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/papers/next.pdf)<br/>

*This paper characterizes the identification of discrete choice models
featuring network externalities (i.e. the dependence of 
consumers' choice-specific payoffs on other consumers' choices)
and uses such a model to study consumers' choice of dating websites.
I show that a general discrete choice model in which
market shares enter consumers' utilities is not identified with 
only market-level data (i.e. data on product characteristics and aggegate market shares
across distinct markets). This nonidentification
reflects that network externalities tend to amplify or dampen the effects of 
product characteristics on tastes. Under certain conditions, microdata allows
for the identification of the model.
I proceed to estimate a model of dating website choice with network externalities, which
I used to study how network externalities affect the effects of changes in
market characteristics on various outcomes.*

#### <u>Sources of limited consideration and market power in e-commerce: the case of contact lenses</u>


*Much of the literature on demand for goods sold online relies on search costs to justify (i) price dispersion across stores selling physically identical products and (ii) consumers’ limited consideration of available online sellers. But vertical differentiation between retailers, store loyalty, and heterogeneous tastes for retailers provide alternative explanations for price dispersion and limited search in e-commerce. I study the contributions of these aspects of consumer preferences to search behavior and retailer market power in the context of contact lens e-commerce. The contact lens setting is suitable for studying consumer search because consumers require brand-specific prescriptions to purchase lenses online, enabling the researcher to rule out cross-brand search and focus on cross-store search. Consumers in my data exhibit severely limited consideration: 83% of their search efforts involve a visit to only one store. Additionally, the consumer pays on average 16% above the minimum available price for her prescribed brand. My paper proposes a model of sequential consumer search and estimates the model on a panel dataset of search efforts. A novel combination of inequalities implied by Weitzman’s (1979) optimal sequential search strategy and a distributional assumption on search costs yields rank-order logit choice probabilities that simplify the estimation of the model. I find that store loyalty and consumers’ persistent idiosyncratic tastes for particular stores largely explain why consumers visit few stores and pay prices above the minimum prices available. Additionally, decreasing search costs increases the average amount that the consumer pays for contact lenses above the minimum available price. This is because lower search costs help the consumer find stores matching her tastes in non-price dimensions. Last, store loyalty and persistent idiosyncratic tastes for stores provide online retailers with considerable market power whereas search costs have little effect on equilibrium retailer markups.*
