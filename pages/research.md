#### <u>Network externalities in the dating website industry</u>

*This paper characterizes the identification of discrete choice models
featuring network externalities (i.e. the dependence of 
consumers' choice-specific payoffs on other consumers' choices)
and uses such a model to study consumers' choice of dating websites.
I show that a general discrete choice model in which
market shares enter consumers' utilities is not identified with 
only market-level data (i.e. data on product characteristics and aggegate market shares
across distinct markets). This nonidentification
reflects that network externalities tend to amplify or dampen the effects of 
product characteristics on tastes. Under certain conditions, microdata allows
for the identification of the model.
I proceed to estimate a model of dating website choice with network externalities, which
I used to study how network externalities affect the effects of changes in
market characteristics on various outcomes.*
